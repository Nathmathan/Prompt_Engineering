However, the polynomial model seems to suggest, as expected, that insurance charges ramp up more as the age of the patient gets higher with the charge of the youngest and oldest patients being higher than the predicted charges of the respective ages in the linear model. Ultimately, I think the polynomial model is better suited for this situation as the insurance charges aren't likely to have a linear relationship with ages.\n"
